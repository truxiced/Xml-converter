    <h2>About</h2>
    <footer>This project is created for the purpose for a assignment. For this I have used a couple of different libs to get the structure of the project.
        This is some of them, check the package.json for the complete list and version: </footer>

    <footer>I choose to use NodeJS as the server for a couple of reasons. But mainly because simplicity and time. It could also have been done with a java web application with Jersey.</footer>

    <p>Simple converter</p>
    <footer>The simple converter allows you to paste a text direct in the browser which will be converted in javascript to XML.
        I have created 3 Backbone.Model object (people, person and family) which is populated with the data from the text area. Each model converts its own data to XML with a recursive function.</footer>

<blockquote>
    <p>Backend converter REST</p>
    <footer>This is similar to the simple converter. Once again the 3 Backbone.Models are used to store the data.
        This time im not using the recursive function to generate the XML but sending it as a POST method to the server. On the server side I used a lib called json2xml to convert it to xml and send it back in the response.

<blockquote>
    <p>Backend converter Socket</p>
    <footer>Since I don't think its i good ide to use HTTP POST method to call a function to do a calculation on the server side and there return a different typ of model,
        I used Socket.io to let the client send the json string to the server with sockets. This can also be used as Server Side Event when updating statistics and so on.
